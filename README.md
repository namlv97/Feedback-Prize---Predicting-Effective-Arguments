# Feedback-Prize---Predicting-Effective-Arguments

This git contains notebook with three main phrases
- Phrase 1: Preprocessing data
- Phrase 2: Load and train with Deberta + concat 4 last layers + K-fold
- Phrase 3: Submission
- Phrase 4: This phrase only is used for crash GPU case

Note: Because of the required internet mode is offline in the notebook and it must be run once again when submitting -> cant use nltk library to preprocess dataset
